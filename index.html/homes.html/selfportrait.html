                    self portrait project. I took some inspiration from online and that really helped me come up with my self-portrait. To be honest, this was a tough project. Just the part where I have to perceive myself and draw what I look like was hard. I don't know how others see me and how much it differs from how I see myself. Even after I finished this self portrait, I asked my friends if this looked like me. Many said no, which was interesting to me. To me, this portrait looks like me. I think there could be a better visualization of me, but I am not sure yet of what I could add. </p>
