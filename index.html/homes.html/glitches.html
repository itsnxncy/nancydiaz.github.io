                <p class="intro-text">Hello! You have chosen PONYO! This page is about my glitch adventure. For my first glitch, it revoles around one of my interests which is watching Studio Ghibli films. I love them! I wanted to make a glitch on one of the film's character which is Ponyo. Never did I see myself making a glitched image with a program called Audacity, but this was a fun experience. I was able to put two effects which I thought made it look great. Those two effects are echo and fade. The effects gave it a cool chaotic glitch, which I love. It looks like something I would wear as a graphic on a t-shirt. This effect did take some time to do just based on downloading the correct format of files and figuring out how everything works. At the end, this was a rewarding experience that gave me something new that I could show other people! </p>
                <p class="intro-text">For my second glitch, it was more of a simple process. My favorite pets are cats so I chose an image of a black cat because I love playing with them whenever I see them. This was my first time making a glitch through text edit and it was an easy process. I did not see my glitch coming out like that, but I am glad it did, gave the image a new meaning. The cats look like they are teleporting to another dimension, it is like there is two dimensions in one image. I love the blue coloring. I am glad I didn't break the image in my first try.  </p>
                <p class="intro-text">For the third glitch, another interest of mine and my favorite character is Kirby. I love this image because it is so peaceful and aesthetic. I used textedit, but I made a "mistake" and half of the image is gone. But I like to think of this image as an intentional mistake, like the image is always in progress so it keeps loading and progressing. At the bottom, there is a small part where you can see glitching, its as if the image is loading, which I love. I didn't expect to break the image but I scrolled too far through the text editor. I am happy with my results though and the new meaning it gave!</p>
