                <p class="intro-text">Hello! You have chosen PONYO! This page is about my glitch adventure. One of my interests involves watching Studio Ghibli films. I love them! I wanted to make a glitch on one of the film's character which is Ponyo. Never did I see myself making a glitched image, but this was a fun experience. I was able to put two effects which I thought made it look great. Those two effects are echo and fade. The effects gave it a cool chaotic glitch, which I love. It looks like something I would wear as a graphic on a t-shirt. This effect did take some time to do just based on downloading the correct format of files and figuring out how everything works. At the end, this was a rewarding experience that gave me something new that I could show other people!  ...</p>
