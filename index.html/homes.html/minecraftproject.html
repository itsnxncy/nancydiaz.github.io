I wanted to print out something that holds meaning to me. The Studio Ghibli films are movies that feel like home to me. Plus, this character is really cute and I love the vibe it gives off. It can be used as decoration anywhere in my home because of the coloring. The coloring is neautral and earthy, which I love!   </p>

I wanted a simple home that could easily be decorated and the inside could be useful to put chests and a bed. I love the touch of pink that pops out. I haven't played Minecraft in a while so seeing the new updates made me get back to it and I am glad I spawned next to a Cherry Blossom Biome.</p>
